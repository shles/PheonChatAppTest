# Test assignment
## Assignment
Write a single view app in swift - a simple chat. The app should allow the user to
enter some text (up to 300 symbols) and respond with a reversed string.
- Use UICollectionView (using diffable datasource and compositional layout
would be a plus)
- Reversing a string should happen on a background thread (using structured
concurrency will be a plus)
- Using viper would be a plus
